# User Directory

> [Users](/getting-started/glossary#users) are the individual accounts for logging in to the App. Each user belongs to a
> [Role](/getting-started/glossary#roles) which defines its [Permissions](/getting-started/glossary#permissions). The
> User Directory shows all users within the project, each with their own customizable profile page.

## Browsing Users

![User Directory Overview](../assets/app/user-directory-overview.png)

Lists all users of the project, with a navigation that allows quick access to the different role groups. This page has
the same functionality as other [Content Pages](/app/content-collections/).

## Viewing a User

![User Overview](../assets/app/user-overview.png)

Users are referenced throughout the app, often for accountability purposes. Hovering over a user in this context will
provide a popover for basic information, and clicking that popover will navigate you to a readonly view of that user's
profile page.

## Editing a User

You can access your profile page from the User Directory or by clicking the User Menu in the
[Module Bar](/app/overview/#_1-module-bar). The profile page has the same features and functionality as the
[Item Page](/app/content-items/). Administrators can customize the fields on this page, but the following are available
by default.

- **First Name** — The given name
- **Last Name** — The family/surname
- **Email** — A unique email address
- **Password** — A hashed system password
- **Avatar** — An image to represent the user
- **Location** — The city, country, office, or branch name
- **Title** — The professional staff title
- **Description** — A freeform text description
- **Tags** — Keywords for searchability
- **Language** — The preferred App language/locale
- **Theme** — Light or Dark mode (or based on system preferences)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** — Configuration for MFA
- **Email Notifications** - Receive emails for notifications

The sidebar's info component also includes the following readonly details:

- **User Key** — The primary key of the user
- **Last Page** — The last App page accessed by the user
- **Last Access** — The timestamp of the user's last App or API action
